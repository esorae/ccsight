# CLAUDE.md

See [README.md](README.md) for usage. Press `?` in TUI for key bindings.

## Build & Development

```bash
cargo build --release        # Build
cargo run                    # Run TUI
cargo test                   # Run tests
cargo clippy -- -D warnings  # Lint (warnings are errors)
bash scripts/lint.sh         # Project lint (UI patterns, safety)
bash scripts/install-hooks.sh   # One-time pre-commit hook setup
```

The pre-commit hook runs the three checks above on every commit.

## Smoke test (tmux)

The TUI can't launch from a non-interactive shell — use tmux at **140x45** (the
size popup-width math assumes; smaller terminals truncate rightmost columns).
Wait `sleep 5` after launch for data + tantivy index, `sleep 1` between keys.
A reference scenario covering Tools popup, search → conv pane, filter / project
popups, and Insights detail lives in `scripts/smoke.sh`. Watch for: rightmost
column truncation, popup borders missing `border_style`, `▼/▶` arrow inversion,
"Searching..." stuck after Enter (index not committed — see lint #18).

## Monkey test

When asked to "broadly inspect ccsight" or after large refactors, use the smoke
script as a starting point but go beyond — visit every popup and tab, compare
the same number across surfaces, and flag anything that disagrees. Past
sessions caught regressions matching these patterns:

- **Same number, different views**: TUI Overview vs Costs panel vs `--daily`
  CLI total. Dashboard preview's stale count vs the popup's `⚠ N stale`. The
  Insights metrics row vs the detail popup's "Usage by category".
- **Same word, different meanings**: "groups" once meant 31 in the popup and
  61 in the preview. "stale" once mixed `>30` and `>=30` thresholds.
- **Tab/section indices**: Help text says `1-N`; verify each digit jumps to
  the named section. Cycle with Tab/h/l and ensure the order matches.
- **Configured but unused**: every category (Skills / Commands / Subagents /
  MCP) should surface installed-but-never-invoked entries. If a tab only
  shows entries from `tool_usage`, it's missing them.
- **Empty / loading state**: searching while the index hasn't committed must
  show "Searching...", not "No results". Same for data reload.
- **Truncation & ellipsis**: long names should end with `…`, never raw cut.
- **Mid-session mutability**: model badges, custom titles, branches must
  reflect the LAST value, not the first (see `extract_session_model`).
- **Scroll bounds**: scrollbar `N/M` should reach M, not stop short. j/k past
  the visible end should not produce blank rows.

When you find a discrepancy, prefer surfacing all of them in one report
before fixing — fixes often fan out into multiple sites that share a value.

## Architecture

`ls src/` shows the file tree; this section only covers modules whose purpose
isn't obvious from the filename.

| Module | Why it exists |
|--------|---------------|
| `aggregator/mod.rs` | `extract_session_model` walks entries reverse so mid-session `/model` switches are reflected in the badge. |
| `aggregator/pricing.rs` | `models_without_pricing` set — models absent from the pricing table are surfaced (Overview `*`, Insights, MCP `stats.pricing_gap`) instead of silently $0. |
| `aggregator/tool_category.rs` | Classifies every tool key into `BuiltIn` / `Mcp` / `Skill` / `Agent` / `Command`. UI order: **Tools (Built-in + MCP) → Skills → Commands → Subagents**. `format_tool_short` strips the `skill:` / `agent:` / `command:` prefix (sections already convey category). |
| `infrastructure/mcp_config.rs` | Joins `~/.claude.json` + plugin `.mcp.json` with observed `tool_usage`. `is_underutilized(now, 30)` is the canonical "stale" predicate. Servers in logs but absent from current config are **inactive**, not stale. |
| `infrastructure/resource_config.rs` | `discover_configured_resources()` walks `~/.claude/{skills,commands,agents}/` plus enabled plugin paths so the Tools popup can show 0-call rows for installed-but-unused entries. |
| `infrastructure/cowork_source.rs` | Claude Desktop Cowork audit logs (Anthropic-private format — undocumented, may break between Claude Desktop releases). Discovery is silent on parse failure so per-file errors don't crash the TUI. |
| `infrastructure/search_index.rs` | tantivy ngram(2,3) index at `~/.ccsight/index/`. `update_or_build()` handles fresh / incremental / reuse. |
| `infrastructure/state_dir.rs` | Single source of truth for on-disk state paths (`~/.ccsight/{cache.json,index/,pins.json}`). `migrate_legacy_state_dirs()` is called at startup to relocate pre-1.1 paths. |
| `handlers/mcp_popup.rs` | Tools-tab cursor row math. Coord origin must match the body slicing in `dashboard.rs::draw_dashboard_detail_popup` (see doc comment). |
| `state.rs` | `AppState`, `ConversationPane`, `TextInput`. Adding a field is compiler-checked at every `AppState { ... }` literal. |
| `test_helpers.rs` | `#[cfg(test)]` fixtures. `create_test_state()` returns an `AppState` with deterministic token / cost values. |

## Rules

**Lint-enforced** (single source of truth: `scripts/lint.sh`):

```bash
rg '^# [0-9]+\.' scripts/lint.sh   # current rule list
```

Add new rules by copying an existing block and bumping the number.

**Not lint-enforceable** — these live as doc comments next to the code they
govern, so they're seen at the moment of violation:

- Popup overlay guards (4 sites) → `main.rs::dismiss_overlay`
- TextInput / UTF-8 safety → `state.rs::TextInput`
- Scroll / cursor coord unity → `handlers::mcp_popup::mcp_pre_server_offset`
- Session-representative value → `aggregator::extract_session_model`
- Footer span format → first `let help_spans = vec![ ... ]` in `ui/dashboard.rs`

**Compiler-enforced** (no rule needed):
- AppState init parity — every `AppState { ... }` literal lists every field.
- Real-world identifier shapes — fully covered by lint #16 / #17 / #21.

## Comments

Comments explain invariants, not history. Don't write incidents, prior bug
numbers, captured numbers, or "earlier this was X" into comments — the file
will outlive the incident and the comment will lie. The same applies to test
docstrings, commit-message-flavored doc comments, and `// Why:` blocks.

- ❌ `// Earlier bug: foo screen showed Xx and bar screen Yx for the same row.`
- ❌ `// (regression in vA.B.C where two surfaces disagreed on the count.)`
- ❌ `// User reported data loss on YYYY-MM-DD around HH:MM.`
- ✅ `// Avg is over all months so this panel and the detail popup show the
       same delta for the same row regardless of the visible window size.`
- ✅ `// Number is a session count, not a call count — different from the
       sibling panel that shares the same labels.`

State the rule and why it matters in terms a future reader can verify against
the code in front of them. If the "why" is a past incident, that belongs in
the commit message or PR description.

## Tests — three layers

| Layer | When | How |
|-------|------|-----|
| Unit (`#[test]`) | Pure logic (aggregation, formatting, classifiers). | `cargo test`; lives next to the code. |
| Render (`TestBackend`) | UI text / layout / row regression. | `render_to_text(&mut state, w, h)` in `ui/mod.rs::tests`. Use `create_test_state()`. Test 120x35, 140x45 (popup math), 60x20 (narrow). |
| Smoke (tmux) | Real-data, async paths (index build, summary), cross-popup key sequences. | `scripts/smoke.sh`; capture with `tmux capture-pane -p`. |

Pick the lowest layer that exercises what you changed.

## Tools detail popup

Tab order: **0=Tools, 1=Skills, 2=Commands, 3=Subagents** (`tools_detail_section`).
The Tools tab merges Built-in tools and MCP servers into one expandable list;
the other three each render their own category. Every tab also surfaces
"configured but never used" entries as zero-call rows (`░░░ 0 0% · never` in
`LABEL_SUBTLE`) sourced from `state.mcp_status` (Tools) or
`state.configured_resources` (Skills / Commands / Subagents).

Cursor / scroll math has to agree across four sites:

1. Body layout in `dashboard.rs::draw_dashboard_detail_popup` active==0
2. Group enumeration in `mcp_popup::collect_mcp_servers`
3. `mcp_pre_server_offset` (header row count)
4. `dashboard::tool_usage_line_count` (scroll bound = rendered rows)

Stale = configured & `is_underutilized(now, 30)`. This single predicate powers
the preview legend, the popup `⚠`, and the Tier 3 alert — never re-implement
the threshold inline (lint #19).

## Key Patterns

- **Search state**: `[Normal] → / → [Search] → Enter → [Preview] → Esc → [Search] → Esc → [Normal]`. Preview saves tab/position via `search_saved_state`.
- **Pane search**: VS Code style — Enter/Shift+Enter = next/prev, Esc closes the bar (n/N still work).
- **Async**: Background threads for data load, summary, index build via `mpsc::channel`. UI must show "Searching..." (not "No results") while a loading flag is set.
- **MCP tools** (`mcp.rs`): `stats` (+ per-server `mcp_servers` snapshot), `sessions`, `search`. All share `date_from` / `date_to` (`YYYY-MM-DD`, local timezone).
- **Costs include subagents**: Overview, Costs panel, and `--daily` CLI all sum over `group.sessions` so totals match. `cost_without_subagents` was renamed `daily_costs_total`.
- **stderr is forbidden** — writes corrupt the TUI rendering. Lint #20 enforces.
