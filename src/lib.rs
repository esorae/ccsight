//! need. The TUI / MCP / aggregator / run loop stay in the binary (`main.rs`),
//! which re-exports these modules so `crate::` paths resolve in both crates.
//!
//! Nothing outside the binary consumes this crate, so the split earns its keep
//! only if a second consumer appears — but the modules are `pub`, so a release
//! that collapses it is a semver break for anyone depending on `ccsight` as a
//! library.
